// Example of TypeScript (Strict)
// We cannot excute the typescript file directly because JS/Node only understand js file
// The Process of TS to JS conversion is called transpilation
// To compile the TS file into JS file, we need to run npx tsc command (tsc-typescript compiler) 
var name1 = "Dinesh"; // Declaration and Initialization
console.log(name1);
var age; // Decleration
age = 37;
console.log(age);
